Project to learn data visualization in python. 

Note: making videos in python is a bad idea. There are a lot of weird, finickety things that can go wrong and do. Which is exactly why I'm making videos. Things go wrong in weird ways - which forces me to learn the inner workings of how plotting and videos work.

Packages: matplotlib, geopandas, moviepy, shapely

# Goals:
1. Make some interesting videos for YouTube
2. Learn basics of sound design and style
3. Maybe make a python package.

# Ideas
1. Tourism data following that medium article
2. how interconnected countries are
3. Crime?
4. Lok Sabha Results over time
5. Visualize who lived at same time
* Narrow down to US presidents
* horizontal plot, name in front of line
* view 20 years at a time
* line is if person is alive at that time
* color with political party? - definitely color with term of office, also color if vice president
* mark birth year?
* US song - battle hymn of the republic (start around t=15s)
* we have ~300 years of presidents born, so about 30s run time
